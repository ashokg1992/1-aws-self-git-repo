#  how you secure aws account ?
- by implementnig MFA by enforcing storng passwd for users.
- regularly reviewing iam activities, implememting some monitoirinng activities , implemneting some alert meachnisams,integarte with some third party    applications, getting alerts when unauthorized  activities happen.
-to monitor ec2s, databases,  user acivities, we use tool slike data dog, splunk. site24/7, dyna trace,. we integrate our aws accoint with those third party tools, monitoring applicarions so that we get alrts 
- another option is by using iam access analayzer , it helpls to understand what policies we have, what permisions we are getting, 

 how yu secure your load balancers, ec2, data bases, 
- to secure  resources we run our workload  in custom  vpc private subnets, we do not open traffic everyone, we implement white list and black list for desired networks,  also load balancer is added with ssl tls and for this we use ACM service. 
- access logs, flow logs, vpc level acess logs  at load balancer level, implement WAF on top of load balancer, 

# WAF
-it protect web applications from common web exploits.
- some expllits: sql injections, vulnerabilities like csrf attcks, brute forece attacks  ad light  force attacks, for all these we create WAF and add this  to web application firewall on top of LB,  api gateways . or on top of  application load balncers, or cloud front distribution , so that it check traffic that coming and filters and p

- 
# WEB ACLs
- 

# shield
- it protects from ddos attacks
- shied advanced: we get support 24/7 
- to protect resources , we use shield and cloud front . we use cloud front on top of applicatoion delivery, cloud front also capable to handle ddos attacks
- in cloud front we have options like geo traffic restrictions, so that we can white list some specific couontires 
- and also cloud distribution has option  called signed url and cookies to protect web applications
- 

# kms
- it help us to encrypt most of the resosurces, we can encrypt most of resources like s3, ebs, 
- even if user has access full for any resouces, but not able to access , then  reasons are he do not have encrypt and decrypt  permission, 
-

# secret manager
- by this we can store and rotate and manage  usernames and 
- we can also integrate with this kms with lambda functions, and this lambda function can rotate  secretes automatically
-

# system manager parameter store
- 

# how you handle security incidents or breaches that happend in aws environment 
- first we have in organization , we need to have instant response plan.  to  track all these we use config, cloud trial for all user activity and api activity, . in cloud trial we  have insights events tells unusaual activity,  we take necessary steps to mitigate in future

4. **How can you restrict access to an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) based on IP address?**
  *Answer:* You can configure an ALB to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses by using security groups / Network ACLs or AWS WAF rules.

5. **What is the purpose of SSL termination on a load balancer?**
  *Answer:* SSL termination offloads the SSL decryption process from the backend servers to the load balancer, improving performance and reducing the server's CPU usage.

6. **What are some best practices for securing applications hosted on AWS?**
  *Answer:* Best practices include regular security patching, implementing WAF rules, using security groups and NACLs, and monitoring application logs.

#### AWS WAF and Web ACL:

7. **What is AWS WAF and how does it help in securing web applications?**
  *Answer:* AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits. It can filter and monitor incoming web traffic to your application. You can protect against vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks by implementing security measures such as input validation, output encoding, and using security headers.

8. **What is a Web ACL in AWS WAF?**
   *Answer:* A Web ACL is a set of rules that define the conditions under which a web application firewall allows or blocks requests to your application.

9. **What is the benefit of using AWS Managed Rules with AWS WAF?**
   *Answer:* AWS Managed Rules are pre-configured rulesets provided by AWS that can help protect your web applications from common threats without the need for manual rule creation.


#### AWS Shield:

10. **What is AWS Shield and how does it help protect against DDoS attacks?**
   *Answer:* AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS against network and transport layer attacks.
   
11. **How does AWS Shield protect against network and transport layer DDoS attacks?**
   *Answer:* AWS Shield provides always-on network flow monitoring, near real-time attack visibility, and automatic traffic anomaly detection and mitigation.

12. **What is the difference between AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced?**
   *Answer:* Shield Standard provides protection against most common and frequent DDoS attacks. Shield Advanced provides enhanced protection, including additional DDoS mitigation capacity and 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT).

#### Amazon CloudFront:

13. **How can you use Amazon CloudFront to enhance the security of your web applications?**
   *Answer:* CloudFront can be used to distribute content securely through HTTPS, implement geo-restriction, and integrate with AWS WAF to protect against web application attacks.

14. **What is Origin Access Identity (OAI) in Amazon CloudFront?**
