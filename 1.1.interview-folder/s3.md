========= my notes =================

- we can access s3 objects  by various tools like athena , glue.
- it is for to  store and backup data/ objects.
- we use s3 in organization for storing loga , applications logs, storing backup of files, etc.
-we integrate s3 with cloudfront service to decrese latency.
- versioning is help us to protect  accidental deletion.
-we use s3 standard storage class in our organization, 
- s3 types standrad--to- infrequesnt-- glacier-- 
- under s3- management - jlifecucle rules we can do settings for bucket lifecycle rules.
- to replicate same data of s3 bucket into other buckert in diff region, for this "replication" option we can do this. in this we give source and destination bucket,

# 
- object may not  upload/ replicate, then wo do check object and replication status in management, check replication role,  and we reviw and check policies, and also check if other bucket is enables with other encryption key, 
- waht kind of encryption yu  use and which  service you use it?
by default sse-s3, . sse-kms, dsse-kms, 
- first we crate kms key  and  apply  it for s3, 
- s3 supports only symmetruic keys,
- if bucket is encrypted and want to use other users, then they should have this encryption key usage permissions. then they can use this bucket
- eventhough user has all permisins, if user does not kms service key access permisions, then user dont able to use it.
- by using "event function" we can trigger events
-by using"cloud trila  data envetns" we can store all logs into  a bucket.
- how you resict public access and bucket policy and how configure?
by using buckert policy we can restrict users access.
# what is ACL  in s3?
- we can give read/write permission to other aws accounts by ACL.

# what is CORS in s3?
cross origin rrsource sharing.

# how you monitor s3 bucket
by using cloud watch we can see how many  objects , bucket size etc.. and also we can see 400 0 500 errors 

# how you enable logging for this?
- by  using cloud trial, create trial, select "data events" , select required buckets for logging.
# by ebs, we mouont to only one ec2
#by efs we mount mlany ec2

# for monitoring we have cloud watch, while for logging we have cloud trial.
