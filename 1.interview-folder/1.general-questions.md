Q: You notice a sudden spike in server CPU utilization. How would you troubleshoot and identify the root cause?**
 - A: 1st check CPU usage using `top` or `htop`,
- then check which process consume m ost cpu resource `ps` or `pidstat`,
-then  analyze logs for events, and optimize or scale resources accordingly.

Q: A critical application on your Linux server is unresponsive. Walk me through the steps you would take to diagnose and resolve the issue.**
 - A:  use `ps` and `top` to identify the hung process, 
-check logs for errors, 
- restart the application or services, and monitor for improvements.

 Q: You need to deploy a new version of a web application on a Linux server without causing downtime. Explain the steps you would take to achieve a zero-downtime deployment.** 
 - A: Implement a load balancer, deploy the new version on one server at a time, validate each step, and update the load balancer to include new servers.

 Q: A team member accidentally deleted important files on a Linux server. How would you recover the lost data? 
 - A: I'd use file recovery tools like `extundelete` or `photorec`, avoid writing new data to prevent overwriting, and restore from backups if available.

 Q: Your Linux server is running out of disk space. What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue, considering both short-term and long-term solutions?**
 - A: Identify large files with `du` and `df`, remove unnecessary files, implement log rotation, and consider long-term solutions like additional storage.

 Q: Explain how you would set up and configure a basic firewall on a Linux server to enhance its security.**
 - A: Use `iptables` or `firewalld` to set up rules, allow only necessary ports and services, and regularly review and update firewall rules.

 Q: Your team is working on a collaborative project, and you want to implement version control using Git on a Linux server. How would you set up and manage the Git repository?**
 - A: Initialize a Git repository with `git init`, add and commit files, push to a central repository, and collaborate using branches and pull requests.

 *Q: You want to monitor the performance of your Linux server over time. What tools and techniques would you use for performance monitoring and analysis?**
 - A: Use tools like `sar`, `vmstat`, and `iostat` for monitoring, set up alerts for abnormal behavior, and consider long-term solutions like Prometheus.
 
Q: You are responsible for securing a Linux server. Outline the security measures and best practices you would implement to protect against potential threats.**
 - A: Keep the system and software updated, configure a firewall, implement strong user authentication, regularly audit and review system logs, and apply the principle of least privilege.


 

1. **Scenario:** Your organization is experiencing intermittent outages in its production environment, impacting customer experience. How would you approach troubleshooting and resolving these outages?

 **Answer:** Initially, I would gather information from monitoring tools, such as alerts, logs, and metrics, to understand the scope and severity of the outages. I would then conduct a systematic investigation, starting with identifying recent changes or deployments that may have triggered the issue. Additionally, I would analyze system performance metrics and conduct stress tests to identify any bottlenecks or resource constraints. If necessary, I would engage with cross-functional teams, including developers and network engineers, to gain insights and collaborate on troubleshooting efforts. Once the root cause is identified, I would work towards implementing a resolution plan, including rollback procedures if applicable, and preventive measures to avoid future occurrences.

2. **Scenario:** Your team is tasked with optimizing costs in the cloud environment without sacrificing performance or reliability. How would you approach this challenge?

 **Answer:** To optimize costs in the cloud environment, I would start by conducting a comprehensive review of our cloud resources and usage patterns. I would leverage cloud cost management tools, such as AWS Cost Explorer or Google Cloud Cost Management, to analyze spending and identify areas for optimization. This may involve rightsizing instances, implementing reserved instances or savings plans, leveraging spot instances for non-critical workloads, and optimizing storage and data transfer costs. Additionally, I would establish cost monitoring and governance processes to track spending and enforce cost-saving policies across the organization.

3. **Scenario:** Your team is adopting a microservices architecture for a new project, and you're tasked with designing a monitoring solution to ensure the reliability and performance of the microservices. How would you approach this task?

 **Answer:** In designing a monitoring solution for a microservices architecture, I would focus on capturing key metrics related to service health, performance, and dependencies. This may include metrics such as response times, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization for each microservice. I would leverage distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to trace requests across service boundaries and identify performance bottlenecks. Additionally, I would implement centralized logging and aggregation using tools like ELK stack or Splunk to correlate logs and metrics for troubleshooting purposes. Visualization tools such as Grafana or Kibana would be used to create dashboards and alerts for real-time monitoring and analysis of system behavior.
